git-github-workshop
===================

Materials for our git&amp;github workshop.

For the demo, we will be in groups of 2-3 people. The files here contain a bug giving unexpected behaviour. The bug is related to encapsulation, but the nature of the bug is not really relevant to understanding the demo. The bug is just there to make the demo a little more realistic ;)

As we will be practicing setting up our own repositories from scratch, you can just download the files in a zip archive (at the bottom right on the page there is a button stating 'Download ZIP'). We will then copy the files over to your own empty repository.
