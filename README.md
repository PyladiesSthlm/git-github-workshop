git-github-workshop
===================

Materials for our git&amp;github workshop that was held the 16th November 2013.

For the demo, we were in groups of 2-3 people. The files here contain a bug giving unexpected behaviour. The bug is related to encapsulation, but the nature of the bug is not really relevant to understanding the demo. The bug is just there to make the demo a little more realistic ;)

The demo went through the following:  

1. Local git configurations  

2. Setting up a Github repository and a local repository from scratch  

3. Add, commit, push  

4. How to use gitignore  

5. Adding collaborators on Github  

6. Clone and pull  


A terminal output file has been added to this repository for those that wish to recap what we went through and for those that missed the demo.

As the demo was done in groups of 2-3, and I was demonstrating on one machine, I had two local folders called "PERSON_1" and "PERSON_2". Eveything done in the folder "PERSON_1" was what person 1 in a group was supposed to do, and everything done in the folder PERSON_2" was what person 2 in a group was supposed to do.
